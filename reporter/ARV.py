"""
Begins from a config file and computes the ARV distribution
    - Load the config: 70% of distribution goes to ARV
    - Fetch ARV stakers and save
    - Fetch and write the first DB entry:
        - Recipient: ARV Balance, Auxo Lock Balance, Boosted ARV Balance, Time remaining, block snapshot
    - Fetch and write the second DB entry:
        - This is just a combination of on and offchain votes
    - Take the existing data for delegates, stakers and votes and write the 3rd DB entry
        - Active and Inactive recipients
    - Get rid of the staking manager logic, we donâ€™t need
    - Apply distribution logic
    - Write claims to the claims file
