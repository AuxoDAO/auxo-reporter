# pie-reporter

A collection of scripts enabling analysis of PieDAO staking initiative.

## How to run

First, init a virtualenv:

```
python3.8 -m venv ./env # creates a python virtualenv
source ./env/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To build a distribution:

```
python ./reporter/run.py conf
python ./reporter/run.py build <current-epoch-folder> <previous-epoch-folder>
python ./reporter/run.py report <current-epoch-folder>
```
